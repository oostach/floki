# Floki project

My Floki project is a Ruby on Rails web application that I have created as a sandbox environment to experiment with new features and technologies within the framework. Ruby on Rails is a widely used web development framework that provides developers with a powerful set of tools and conventions to build web applications quickly and efficiently. The framework uses a model-view-controller architecture, which helps developers keep their code organized and maintainable. Additionally, Ruby on Rails is highly extensible, with a large number of community-supported plugins and gems available for developers to use.
